# Not just a software developer.
Hola! This is Shaurya Srivastava, a full-time IoT enthusiast and a part-time digital musician. I'm currently in 10th standard, but I started off wayyy back in class 5. I've built and programmed many IoT projects from the ground up, such as a **"3 Channel Mixer"**, **"MIDI Drum Kit"**, and a custom program for those **sweet RBG LEDs**. Currently I'm working on *Game Development* and programming the *Raspberry Pi*. I take an active interest in managing and programming *wireless communication and storage systems*, such as **FTP servers and Radios**.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on File Management Systems
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++, Python, HTML
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm an Indian Classical Music scholar, but I love messing with Digital Music too.
